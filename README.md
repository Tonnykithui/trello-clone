This was a simple DRAG & DROP project I did as a clone of the popular site Trello.
After cloning the project, run the command "npm i" to get all packages used.
The project utilises a json file as a database. To get data from the json file run the command "npm run server". This will enable sending data and receiving from our json file as the database.
To get the UI run the command "npm run start". This will spin up the UI for you to interact with.
Enjoy toying with this project.
Open to interesting projects to collaborate on, if you got something in mind then reach out.
